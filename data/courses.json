    "details": "Motion Graphics involves creating graphics and moving them in time and space to achieve an intended goal or tell a story. The motion graphic elements are placed in a sequence of frames to create an illusion of motion. Unlike other forms of animation, animated motion graphics primarily use graphics and type. Motion graphics is animation, but with text as a major component. Essentially, it’s animated graphic design. Ever since motion graphics first entered the scene, there’s been a debate about the line between them and full animation. The opening credits of Hitchcock’s Psycho is an early example of motion graphics, where the marriage of sound, motion, and graphic design come together exceptionally well."
